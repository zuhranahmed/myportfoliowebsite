            Hey there! my name is <strong>Zuhran Ahmed</strong>. I am a
            self-taught <strong>front-end developer</strong> and
            <strong>digital media marketer</strong>. I started my journey with
            programming back in 2016 when I just found out that there's a whole
            universe of logic behind everything we see online which we achieve
            through programming.
          </p>
          <p class="para-2">
            So, I started searching for different programming languages and
            ended up with Python. I took a course online and learned about it. I
            did nothing with Python afterwords. At that time I was just jumping
            from one language to another without any clear plan and goal. I also
            learned Java and C++ which I also didn't use in any practical way.
          </p>
          <p class="para-3">
            I was naive and I procrastinated a lot from 2019 to mid-2020. In the
            mid-2020 month of June, I decided that I'm going to learn Front-end
            Development. I took online courses for
            <strong>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</strong>. I learned them
            thoroughly and start practicing. I am still learning and practicing
            to improve my skills as programming is a never-ending journey. I
            also learned <strong>Sass and TailwindCSS</strong>. Besides that, I
            also took <strong>Google's certification</strong> for Digital
            Marketing where I learned about online marketing, SEO, and how to
            make SEO friendly websites. I completed that certification with an
            over <strong>80% score</strong> in their online final exam.
          </p>
          <p class="para-4">
            That's my journey so far which I'll continue to improve for the rest
            of my life. I'm very passionate about what I do and what I learn. I
            always want to learn new stuff and improve my skills.
